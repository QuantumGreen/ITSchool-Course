Create an abstract class 'Animals' with two abstract methods 'cats' and 'dogs'. Now create a class 'Cats' with a
method 'cats' which prints "Cats meow" and a class 'Dogs' with a method 'dogs' which prints "Dogs bark", both inheriting
the class 'Animals'. Now create an object for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods.

Sam's note: This wont work right, because the methods are abstract it would force you to give both of them a body so Cat
class will have to have a dog method inside of it.

You could do one where you have one method called speak, dog barks, cat meows
