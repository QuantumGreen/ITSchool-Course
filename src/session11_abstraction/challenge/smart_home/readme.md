<br>Smart Home Management System
<br>
<br>Description:
<br>With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices, homes are becoming increasingly automated. In this
system, you are tasked with simulating the working of a Smart Home which integrates various devices, automations, user
profiles, and external integrations like weather forecasting.
<br>
<br>Functional Requirements
<br>
<br>User Profiles:
<br>Multiple users can be registered to a home: homeowner, family members, and guests.
<br>Each user profile has varying control levels: homeowners have full control, family members have partial control (
can't add or remove devices), and guests have limited control (can only control devices in common areas).
<br>Users should be able to remotely control devices linked to their profile.
<br>
<br>Device Management:
<br>Various types of devices can be added to the home: lights, thermostats, doors, windows, cameras, entertainment
systems, etc.
<br>Each device type can have unique functionalities: lights can dim, thermostats set temperatures, doors can
lock/unlock, cameras can record or take snapshots, etc.
<br>Devices can be assigned to specific rooms or areas.
<br>
<br>Automations & Scenes:
<br>Users can create "scenes" which are predefined settings for multiple devices: e.g., "Night Mode" might dim the
lights, lock all doors, and set the thermostat to a particular temperature.
<br>Automations can be created based on triggers: e.g., if the outside temperature drops below a certain level, the
heating should turn on.
<br>
<br>External Integrations:
<br>Integrate with a weather service to fetch local weather conditions. This should influence automations: e.g., if it's
about to rain, close all open windows.
<br>Integrate with a local news API to flash breaking news on the entertainment system.
<br>
<br>Energy Management:
<br>Monitor the energy consumption of each device.
<br>Suggest energy-saving automations: e.g., if a room is empty and the lights are on for more than 10 minutes, turn
them off.
<br>Generate monthly energy reports showing the consumption patterns and savings from the automations.
<br>
<br>Security and Alerts:
<br>If a door or window is opened at odd hours, send an alert to the homeowner.
<br>Cameras should automatically start recording if an unrecognized face is detected.
<br>If smoke or fire detectors are triggered, alert all users and switch on all lights for safety.
<br>
<br>Voice Commands:
<br>Simulate voice commands that users can give to control devices: e.g., "Turn off the living room lights" or "Set
thermostat to 22 degrees".
<br>
<br>Maintenance:
<br>Devices should have a "health" or "status" associated with them. If a device is malfunctioning or low on battery, an
alert should be sent for maintenance.
<br>Schedule routine checks for devices.
